        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <h3>Projectile Motion</h3>
            <p>
Projectiles are found in our toy because after the ping pong ball is shot, and its path of motion is that of a projectile. It takes off at an initial distance at a given speed, and then falls down, in the y-direction with an acceleration of 9.8m/s^2.  The projectileâ€™s motion tends to move in a parabolic motion made from the x and y components of the moving object.  The ping pong ball will leave the gun at certain speed in the x direction and constantly maintain that speed the whole while moving (when force of air is negligible).  While gravity is working in the y direction that will actually bring the object down.  Otherwise, the ping pong ball would continue on until worked on by an opposing force.
            </p>
        <h3>Forces</h3>
            <p>
Forces can be found in our project because they are needed to get the ball to moving.  The force exerted on the ball can be found by finding the acceleration and the mass of the object. There is only acceleration in the x direction when it is inside the shooter.  This acceleration is due to force applied from the air.  However, once the ping pong ball exits the shooter, the only force working the ball is gravity.   It is the force of gravity working on the ball that gives it a parabolic path.  In a perfect setting, air would be negligible.  Air, however, does exist and creates a force friction upon the ball- slowing it down only slightly.
            </p>
        <h3>Energy</h3>
            <p>
Energy can be found in the form of kinetic and potential energy in the system between the gun and the ping pong ball.  There is first potential energy formed from the pressurized air in the tank. Once the air is released on the ping pong ball, the ball gains speed.  As the ball gains speed, it also gains kinetic energy. The ball also has potential energy from being held at certain high because of gravity. When the ball is shot out of the shooter, the ball has energy coming from the speed in the x direction and from the y direction- as it gains speed from gravity.  The ball's potential energy in the y direction is greatest in the gun, but the kinetic energy of the ball is greatest when it is about the hit the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
Work is the change in kinetic energy of an object. It is done on the ball inside the shooter as the ball is accelerated from 0 to its constant speed. As the speed of the ball increases, the kinetic energy of the ball also increases. Since there is a change in kinetic energy, there is also work done on the ball. Then once outside the shooter, the ball is worked on by gravity. 
            </p>    
        <h3>Springs</h3>
            <p>
Springs are incorporated into the toy because it pushes the door closed to our reloading mechanism. The spring is compressed to open the door, and which point a ball would slip out in the barrel. Once a new ping pong ball has been loaded, the spring would un-compress to close the door. The spring, with its k constant, will want to return to its normal form- which will close the door.
            </p>
        <h3>Electricity</h3>
            <p>
Electricity can be found in our in our project from the circuits. Our circuit in our toy is used to give it light.  In the circuit, we have a battery that has a switch and light in parallel with each other. The battery we are using in our circuit is a 9V battery, and can be attached and replaced. The wires were soldered together to get the wires to stay together. The switch in the circuit turns the light off and on by cutting off the flow of current.
            </p>
        <h3>Wiring</h3>

            <p>
The Arduino is hooked up to a 9v battery via its 5.5mm power jack with a switch in the middle to power the Arduino on and off. It then outputs a 5v and a ground to the breadboard powering the power rails. Then a ground (black) and power (red) are connected from the power rail onto the main section of the breadboard. To finish of the series a signal wire (yellow) is connected from the main section of the breadboard to the 9th PWM port on the Arduino. These wires then connect to the servo allowing the loaded program to run the servo.
            </p>
            <p>
The circuit is powered by a 9.05v power source which is run in serires. The system has 6.1&Omega; and has 1.484Amps.

            <p>
In order to power the flashlight onboard, a 9v battery was used and conntected in parallel with flashlight. These two are items are split up by a switch allowing for the user to turn the flashlight on and off at any time they desire.
            </p>
            <p>
The total voltage of the system is 9.05v and has a total resistance of 0.6887&Omega; with 13.1407Amps. Since the circuit is in parallel the 9.05v is equally distibuted throught the circuit.
